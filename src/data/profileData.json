Volleyball has taught me teamwork and discipline, and singing is where I let loose. Now, I'm on a mission to find a major that lets me blend both of these worlds, whether it's sports management, sports science, or maybe even music therapy. I'm all ears for any advice or insights you've got, and let's tackle this academic journey together, with volleyball and singing as my trusty guides. ",
