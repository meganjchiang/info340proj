        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>We want to create an app that provides guidance and resources to prospective and current UW students. Many students struggle with deciding their major and career. Oftentimes advisors don't fully understand the student perspective, so it would be more helpful to speak with alumni. It would also be helpful to have one place of information for every major, rather than having to search through countless sites to get information about majors, such as the different types (capacity-constrained, minimum requirements, or open), prerequisites, and degree audits. The goal of our app is to provide a user-friendly space where they can learn more, make appointments to meet with each other, build a community, and inquire about different career fields all in one place.</p>

        <p>While there are existing sites such as Huskies@Work that do alumni and student matching, they only allow current students to apply and get matched with an alumni. Additionally, Huskies@Work only does mentor matching twice a year, and students can only meet with their assigned mentor. An article from The Harvard Business Review talks about the power of alumni networks and states, “people often self-select into undergraduate and graduate programs that have social groups with interests closely aligned to their own, which generates both a higher level of interaction and longer-lived relationships.” The University of Oregon also talks about how it’s beneficial to reach out and connect with alumni, yet it’s difficult to initiate mentor relationships. Our app provides a way for people to easily access and connect with alumni with convenience.</p>
