        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>We want to create an app that provides guidance and resources to prospective and current UW students. Many students struggle with deciding their major and career. Oftentimes advisors don't fully understand the student perspective, so it would be more helpful to speak with alumni. It would also be helpful to have one place of information for every major, rather than having to search through countless sites to get information about majors, such as the different types (capacity-constrained, minimum requirements, or open), prerequisites, and degree audits. The goal of our app is to provide a user-friendly space where they can learn more, make appointments to meet with each other, build a community, and inquire about different career fields all in one place.</p>

        <p>While there are existing sites such as Huskies@Work that do alumni and student matching, they only allow <em>current</em> students to apply and get matched with an alumni. Additionally, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/alumni/future-alumni/huskiesatwork/">Huskies@Work</a> only does mentor matching twice a year, and students can only meet with their assigned mentor. An article from <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/10/the-power-of-alumni-networks"><cite>The Harvard Business Review</cite></a> talks about the power of alumni networks and states, “people often self-select into undergraduate and graduate programs that have social groups with interests closely aligned to their own, which generates both a higher level of interaction and longer-lived relationships.” <a href="https://career.uoregon.edu/resources/blog/digital-world-flat-alumni-networking-easier-and-more-important-ever"><cite>The University of Oregon</cite></a> also talks about how it’s beneficial to reach out and connect with alumni, yet it’s difficult to initiate mentor relationships. Our app provides a way for people to easily access and connect with alumni with convenience.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <h3>Users</h3>
        <p>
          Our app will be used by the UW community, particularly prospective and current students, alumni, and administrators. This service provides a free resource for mentorship and guidance, allowing users to form connections with those of similar backgrounds and experiences. 
        </p>
        <h3>Interactions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Users can search for specific mentors or filter the entire list based on graduation year, degree, role, industry, etc.</li>
          <li>After finding a mentor, a user is given a list of available dates and times and can make an appointment with them. After confirming the appointment, they will receive a Zoom link of the mentor's personal meeting room. Users also have the option to modify or cancel their appointment.
          </li>
          <li>UW alumni can apply to be mentors through an application form. Administrators of the service can view their applications and decide whether or not to accept them.</li>
          <li>Mentors and mentees can create profiles, showing their name, picture, (intended) degree, graduation year, intended/current industry, and a short biography. They have the option to "connect" with other users.</li>
        </ul>
